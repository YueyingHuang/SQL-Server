        ---

        This notebook demonstrates the **conversion of existing SQL code into Python code** for execution and analysis. The original SQL logic remains intact and has been adapted into Python, ensuring consistency in data processing and results.

        After implementing the Python code, additional business analysis statements were included to provide simple insights based on the outcomes of the original SQL queries. These insights are directly derived from the data without altering the initial logic.

It can be seen that Philadelphia has the highest number of coffee shops, with 57, followed by cities like Edmonton, Nashville, and Tampa, approximately 25. The remaining cities have around one coffee shop, which could be due to insufficient data collection or the smaller size of these cities, resulting in lower demand.

        As mentioned earlier, having too many or too few competitors in the same category may negatively impact the establishment of our business. Therefore, we can choose a city in the second tier of coffee shop numbers as the settlement location. Here, we select New Orleans, a city with a moderate number of coffee shops.

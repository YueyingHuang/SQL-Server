# About Repo:
This repository contains notebooks that outline the steps for processing data and preparing for upload. Some projects are part of a group assignment where different tasks were distributed among team members. 

## Kaggle Data Processing for Azure Upload

This notebook outlines the process of converting data from JSON format into a Pandas DataFrame and preparing it for upload to Azure. The work presented here is part of a group assignment focusing on Kaggle data processing.

### Scope of Contribution

- **Primary Focus**: This notebook specifically covers the conversion of JSON data into a structured Pandas DataFrame.
- **Team Effort**: The remaining tasks, including the Azure upload and presentation of the results, were completed collaboratively in another notebook as part of the groupâ€™s work.

### Key Steps

1. **Data Conversion**:
   - Transform JSON data into a tabular structure using Pandas for easier manipulation and analysis.
   
2. **Azure Preparation**:
   - Ensure the data is properly formatted for seamless upload to Azure services.

### Group Work Reference

The final presentation and the complete pipeline, including Azure integration, are detailed in another notebook, which reflects the collective effort of the group. 

### Acknowledgments

Special thanks to my group members for their contributions and collaboration in completing this project.
